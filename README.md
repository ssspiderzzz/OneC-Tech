Displaying data collected from a form (see the sample output below). When
a user opens your web page you should use the API provided to retrieve the data and display
this on the page. The data was collected using a web based form. You will need to make API
calls to get the submission data (i.e. the data the user inputed) and a second API call to get the
actual form data. You will then need to match this data together to create your output.
